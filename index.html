                    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Terra's calm and cool exterior hides a heart that would fight for his friends. 
                        However, Terra struggles to keep himself on the right path, and is constantly 
                        tempted by the power of darkness. Oblivious to the fact that Master Xehanort is 
                        attempting to seduce him into darkness, he begins to doubt those closest to him, 
                        and only recognizes his mistakes after the fact. While not gullible, Terra can be 
                        overly trusting, which most villains use to their advantage, leading to several of his
                        misadventures.

                    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Ventus is the youngest of the three Keyblade warriors. 
                        Personality-wise, he has many similarities with Sora; he's sweet, cheerful, curious, 
                        and gets excited at anything new or interesting, and he also has Similarities with 
                        Roxas; he can be short-tempered, blunt and stands his ground. He also feels disappointed 
                        whenever Aqua and Terra refuse to allow him to join them on their missions because they do 
                        not want to put him in "harm's way."

                    <p style="font-size: 17px;"> Aqua shows some similarities to Kairi, which she shows by 
                        making good luck charms for her friends. She also has a devotion to her friends similar 
                        to that of Sora's, for she did everything in her power to protect Ventus from harm and 
                        even sacrificed herself to save Terra. She is also similar to Sora in that she holds a 
                        strong sense of justice and desire to do what is right. Her judgments between what is 
                        right and wrong are never misplaced, although Ventus and Terra sometimes lose sight of the 
                        right thing to do. Her personality is serious, kind, strong willed, intelligent, and 
                        responsible, as she is the most reliable of the three.
